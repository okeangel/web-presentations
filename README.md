# Web Presentations

This project contains interactive web presentations for my public talks.

**Main page:** [https://okeangel.github.io/web-presentations/](https://okeangel.github.io/web-presentations/)

## About
- Presentations are shared as web linksâ€”no files or special software needed, just a device with a web browser.
- Each presentation auto-advances at a set pace, requiring no manual navigation.
- Updates are instant: the link always shows the latest version.
